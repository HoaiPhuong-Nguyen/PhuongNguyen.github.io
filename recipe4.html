			<ol>
			<li class="in">Make bone marrow butter: melt butter on the stovetop. Stir in the bone marrow until it becomes a homogenous mixture. Let set completely in the fridge.</li>
			<li class="in">Let the lamb chops go up to room temperature. Season them with salt, pepper and dried oregano, and let sit for at least 10 minutes.</li>
			<li class="in">Boil potatoes until it is soft enough that a fork and go through. Mash them with a potato ricer, then add heavy cream. Season appropriately with salt and 
			pepper and set aside.</li>
			<li class="in">Heat up a cast iron or stainless steel skillet on medium high until the pan is completely hot. Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil. Sear the lamb chops 
			and do not move until a crust has formed from the maillard reaction (it takes approximately 5 minutes per side for a small lamb chop).</li>
			<li class="in">While the lamb chops are searing, dice onions and pears. Set aside.</li>
			<li class="in">Immediately after flipping the lamb chops, crush 2 cloves of garlic and toast the in the pan alongside with some rosemary. Take out approximately 1 tablespoon 
			of your bone-marrow butter, then put them at the same spot as the garlic and rosemary in order for it to be as aromatic as possible. Baste the lamb chops with the butter.
			When done, let the lamb chops rest for 8-10 minutes.</li>
			<li class="in">Take out garlic cloves and rosemary. Saute pears and onions in the fond remained after searing the lambs. After pears and onions soften, add a splash of vodka 
			or any type of white wine. Continue cooking until the alcohol reduces, then add heavy cream and cook until the sauce coats back of a spoon.</li>
			<li class="in">Mix olive oil, honey, salt and pepper for the carrots. Coat the baby carrots in the honey mixture, then bake in 425F oven for 15 minutes.</li>
			<li class="in">Plating: in one corner, take a spoonful of your sweet potato puree and sweep them to create an arch. In another corner, put the pear-onion cream sauce on 
			the bottom and sit the lamp chops on top. Put lettuce leaves on the bottom in one corner and honey carrots on top. Bon appetit!</li>
