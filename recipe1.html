		<p class="marking">Procedures</p>
		<nav>
			<ol>
			<li class="in">Peel apple. Chop ¾ into small chunks, and let all of the peeled apples sit in water and vinegar mixture. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon, and set aside.</li>
			<li class="in">Preheat the oven to 425F, butter and line cake pans with parchment papers and make sure your butter and eggs are room temperature.</li>
			<li class="in">Beat the sugar and butter until it turns pale yellow (almost white). Then crack all your eggs into a seperate bowl (to avoid shells) and
			mix in one egg at a time. Beat on medium high speed for approximately 8 minutes. Then add in the optional vanilla.</li>
			<li class="in">In a separate bowl, mix in all your dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt.</li>
			<li class="in">Add the dry ingredients and buttermilk in the egg and butter mixture alternatively and gradually on low speed. Use spatula to scrape down 
			the side occasionally. Once everything is mixed, stop (do not overmix as the gluten in all-purpose flour can develop, resulting in a tough cake).</li>
			<li class="in">Add a thin layer of cake batter into cake pan, sprinkle the cinnamon mixture on top, and then pour another layer of cake batter on top. 
			Repeat for the remaining of the batter.</li>
			<li class="in">Bake the cakes for 25-30 minutes, and then let cool completely. </li>
			<li class="in">Beat cream with powder sugar until soft peak (right when the cream doesn’t fall off an upside-down bowl). Do not overmix.</li>
			<li class="in">Separate ⅓ of the whipped cream mixture into a piping bag with star tip. Store it in the fridge . Grate ¼ of the apples that 
			didn’t get cut into chunks, and fold in gently with the remaining ⅔ whipped cream.</li>
			<li class="in">Put the whipped cream with grated apples in between layers of the cake. In this recipe I chose to decorate the cake in the naked style 
			(as it is easier when working with whipped cream instead of buttercream frosting), but feel free to decorate any style possible. </li>
			<li class="in">After putting the layers together, store the cake in the fridge while preparing the caramel decorations. Drain the cubed apple pieces, 
			then put them in a pot. Saute them on medium high heat until all the moisture is drawn out. Add a pinch of salt to give your caramel a tinge of salty flavor. Set aside.</li>
			<li class="in">Make a caramel with ½ cup of sugar (you can find a recipe from Food Network <a href= "https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/how-to-make-caramel">here</a>)
			then add in the apple pieces. Pour out on a dish lined with parchment paper. Make another caramel, then use a spoon to draw out any shape you like. 
			Let both the caramel cool completely.</li>
			<li class="in">Take out the cake. Put the caramel-apple piece on top. Dip the pure caramel shapes in the pot with the remaining hot caramel, then put them on top of the 
			caramel-apple piece. Stabilize the shapes until they’re cool completely.</li>
			<li class="in">Pipe the whipped cream in the bag around the caramel “area” in small “flowers”. And, lastly but not leastly, dig in!</li>
