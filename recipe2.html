			<li class="in">Pour 1 pack of gelatin to 1 cup cold water. Let sit.</li>
			<li class="in">Blend raspberries till smooth. Put it through a sieve to take out all the juices. Add water if necessary during the process of straining through the mesh. 
			Set aside the raspberry juice.</li>
			<li class="in">In a pot, mix together peanut butter, ½ cup heavy cream, ⅓ cup sugar until it becomes a homogenous mixture.</li>
			<li class="in">Bring the gelatin to a boil. Set aside 2 tablespoons. Add ⅓ the amount of raspberry juice to the remaining gelatin. Pour the mixture into jelly shaping tools. 
			Let set in the fridge from 4 hours to overnight.</li>
			<li class="in">Whip the cream until it just reaches soft peak (the point when it doesn’t fall down in an upside down bowl). Gently fold in the peanut butter mixture. 
			When it is thoroughly combined, add the 2 tablespoons of gelatin set aside before. Let sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours, up to overnight.</li>
			<li class="in">When serving: make the crust and reduced raspberry sauce. </li>
			<li class="in">To make chocolate crust: Crush crackers into fine pieces. Mix in ½ tablespoon of sugar and 2 tablespoons of butter. Bake at 400F for 8 minutes. 
			For plating, put the crust in the middle of the plate. Put the peanut butter mousse on top and decorate with the raspberry jelly.</li>
			<li class="in">To make reduced raspberry sauce: Put the remaining raspberry in a pot. Let simmer until all the water runs out. Add remaining sugar, reduce until 
			the sauce coats back of a spoon. Use a coffee spoon to add small dots around the plate. Voila! A new take on a classic flavor!</li>
